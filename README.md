# Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning
This repository is a collection of various code from past courses, as well as new code which builds on those foundations. This is intended to be a repository where I aggregate interesting open-source work and approaches in ML/RL.

## Example Code
Testing GitHub Readme Documentation
```
print('hello world!')
```
